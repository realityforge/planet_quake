/*
====================
SV_GentityUpdateHealthField

Update the value of the gentity_t->health field with playerState_t->stats[STAT_HEALTH] for a given player
You need to supply the player's sharedEntity and playerState (because since we have special includes here, we don't have access to the functions that can return a player from their int id).
The concrete effect is that when replaying a demo, the players' health will be updated on the HUD (if it weren't for this function to update the health, the health wouldn't change and stay kinda static).

Note: we need to do that because the demo can only records this stats[stat_health], which is concretely the same as gentity_t->health. The latter should have been removed altogether considering the comments in g_active.c (ent->client->ps.stats[STAT_HEALTH] = ent->health;	// FIXME: get rid of ent->health...), but it seems to have survived because it allows non-player entities to have health, such as obelisks. And weirdly, gentity_t->health has ascendence over stat_health (meaning stat_health is updated following gentity_t->health, but never the other way around), when for example stat_armor has ascendence over anything else of the same kind, so here we have to update it by ourselves.
Note2: this works pretty simply: sharedEntity_t = gentity_t but with only the first 2 fields declared (entityShared_t and entityState_t), but all the other fields are still in memory! We only need to get a valid declaration for gentity_t (which we do by doing the right includes at the top of this file, in g_local.h), and then we can convert the limited sharedEntity_t into a gentity_t with all the fields!

    gentity_t *ent;

    ent = (gentity_t*)gent; // convert the sharedEntity_t to a gentity_t by using a simple cast (now that we have included g_local.h that contains the definition of gentity_t, and at the same time we have linked to g_public.h via g_local.h with the definition of sharedEntity_t)

    ent->health = player->stats[STAT_HEALTH]; // update player's health from playerState_t->stats[STAT_HEALTH] field
